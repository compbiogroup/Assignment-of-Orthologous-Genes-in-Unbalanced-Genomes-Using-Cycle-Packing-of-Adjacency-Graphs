# Dataset of Simulated Genomes (Strings)

Dataset with pairs of strings. Each file is named `LY_MODX.txt`, where `Y` is the alphabet size used to created the source strings, `MOD` is either `REV` or `REV_TRANS`, and `X` is a number defining the number of operations applied to create the target string. The folder are named `MODX` and contain the files ending in `MODX`.

Given the values `X`, `MOD`, and `Y`. The following process is used to create each pair of strings. We first construct the source string S of size 100 such that, at each position i in [1..100], we choose (with replacement and using a uniform distribution) a character from an alphabet of size `Y`. Next, each element from S randomly receives a sign ('+' or '-'). After that, the target string T is generated by applying `X` operations of reversal (if `MOD` = `REV`), or `X/2` reversal and `X/2` transpositions (if `MOD` = `REV_TRANS`, the order of the operations in that case is randomly chosen), in S, followed by `X/4` operations of deletion (deleting a single gene each), followed by `X/4` operations of insertion (inserting a single gene).
